# Trance

Live Lighting control via Wifi.

## USB-DMX

This is a Trance-Controller that can be plugged into Eurolite Quick-DMX USB ports. With this there is no need to power the Controller.

## Software

To ensure a flexible and easy software, there is a Arduino library, that implements the communication side of the software. By updating this Library with more Protocols or more reliable networking, we can expand the functionallity of every trance controller, despite different hardware.

## Vision

- Centralized Provision and setup of trance-family controllers. Inspired by Unifi or Node red.
- Integration with popular open and propriatary smart home systems.
